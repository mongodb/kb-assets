# Build Keyhole as a Snap
To build Keyhole as a snap, [install snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/snapcraft) and run the <code>./build-snap.sh</code> from within the <code>contrib/snapcraft</code> directory. The outputs from the snapcraft build will appear in the project's root directory.

If you need to make configuration changes to the snap, edit the file <code>contrib/snapcraft/snap/snapcraft.yaml</code>
